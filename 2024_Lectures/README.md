## Scripts & Demonstrations

Each lecture folder may also contain Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks illustrating key concepts


## How to Use

1. **Download or Clone**: You can download this section/folder as a ZIP, or clone the entire repository if needed.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Some scripts/notebooks may require libraries such as `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `geopandas`, or `rasterio`. Refer to any `requirements.txt` or environment file in each lecture folder.
3. **Run Examples**: 
   - If you see a `.ipynb` file, open it with Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
