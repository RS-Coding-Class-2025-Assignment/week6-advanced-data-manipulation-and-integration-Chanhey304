# Lectures Folder

Welcome to the **Lectures** folder! Here you will find all the lecture materials, including slides, notes, and any supplementary files for the course. The goal is to keep everything organized so students can easily locate and review content after each lecture.

## Folder Structure

- **Slides/**  
  This subfolder contains presentation files (PowerPoint, PDF, etc.).  
  Each file name should include the lecture number or topic for clarity.  
  Example: `W1_Introduction.pdf`.

- **Notes/**  
  Contains detailed lecture notes or markdown files summarizing key points.  
  Example: `Lecture1_Notes.md`.

- **Scripts/**  
  Code snippets or demonstration scripts used during the lectures.  
  Example: `Lecture1_Demo.py`.

*(Adjust or remove folders as needed, depending on how you organize your lecture files.)*
